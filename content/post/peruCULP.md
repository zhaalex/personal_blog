&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past July, I traveled to Peru for approximately three weeks through ROTC's CU&LP (Cultural Understanding and Language Proficiency) program with 30 other cadets from across the nation to train with the Peru's Escuela Militar de Chorrillos, their version of the United States Military Academy. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons I'm writing my blog post is because I have to discuss with my team leader on my takeaways from this mission and future leadership improvements, so apologies if some parts may seem a little robotic (sections taken from my evaluation).  This trip was nothing like what I expected, but it definitely widened my horizons.  My thoughts below!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people act very differently when assigned leadership roles.  On a military-to-military trip where our field training exercise (FTX) was cancelled and most of our time was spent on "cultural immersions," aka visiting museums and other sorts of cultural mediums to learn more about Peru, there wasn't much to manage, making leadership roles a tad arbitrary.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more responsibility, it is obvious a person needs to have a heightened sense of perceptiveness.  However, it is very evident to others when someone starts to do more when assigned a leadership role.  I'm not arguing for a single side here, I'm merely pointing out an observation.  It is very possible to be a leader without the title; don't let your position, as a leader or not, define how you act.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a group where about half of the people never traveled outside of the United States, it was interesting to see how people would react to a different setting and entirely new culture.  I'm sure they've never had traveler's diarrhea or eaten cuy (guinea pig).  Some took it in stride, while others were less adaptable.  It is important to realize that there are specific problems that come with traveling; for example, becoming ill typically goes in hand with traveling abroad.  To think the opposite is extremely naive.  Thus, we must manage our expectations with unfamiliar food and environments.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are often afraid to put ourselves in the spotlight, where our failures (and successes) are publicly broadcasted.  We lived in the same barracks as the Peruvian cadets, and we would also eat with them, although not as much as I would have liked.  It was hard to bridge the language and cultural gap (although we had a few fluent Spanish speakers), but once I made the effort to engage them in conversation, I learned greatly about their daily schedules and future aspirations.  On the flip side, I noticed some tables would barely socialize, mostly eating in silence.  I'd like to think that most of the material we learned from the museums could be scrounged from the internet, but what really gave value to this mission was the interaction between other cadets, often forcing ourselves into different social environments.  To not take advantage of this is a waste of opportunity.

<h4 align = "center">Managing Expectations</h4 align = "center">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three types of CU&LP missions: military-to-military, humanitarian, and English education.  My mission, military-to-military, focused primarily on military training with our Peruvian counterparts.  This was hardly the case.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our last day during the closing ceremony, our mission commander said, "Training is the best way to bring together cadets from different backgrounds[sic]."  I could not agree with this more.  However, due to the timing of our mission, we barely trained with the Peruvian cadets, partially because it was nearing the end of the school year, and they were rehearsing for their Independence Day parade.  We went with the flow and adapted our schedule to whatever the best alternative was (often visiting cultural sites and playing soccer with the cadets).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this trip ends, it was certainly eye-opening.  To experience the Peruvian culture, not only through the civilian lens, but also through their military has taught me a lot!

<li>Cadets at the academy follow a very strict schedule, as expected of an academy.  They're woken up periodically throughout the night to train sleep deprivation tolerance, and they finally wake up ("Levantanse!") at around 4am to "clean their rooms" until breakfast at 6am.  </li>
