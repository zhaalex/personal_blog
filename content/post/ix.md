Time has flown by since I've gotten here!  
<!--more-->

The 3 days I spent in Dubai before this trip seemed lengthy in comparison the 3 weeks I've been in Cape Town.  For some context, possibly due to my lack of effort, a sophomore internship at whatever company was not in the picture.  I'm also traveling to Peru on a month-long ROTC military-to-military collaboration with Peru's Chorrillo's Military School, where I'll be honing whatever skills I have.

With Peru being smack-dab in my summer timeline and hearing about the great experiences at iXperience (hah) my olders friends had, I decided to sign up for the program (at a small fee).
