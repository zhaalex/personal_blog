<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This is a beginner’s tutorial to building a website through the R Package ‘Blogdown’ and Hugo. Install RStudio (<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/</a>) and R (<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://www.r-project.org/</a>) to get started.</p>
<p>Create an EMPTY directory (make sure it is empty besides the .Rproj file).</p>
<p>Run the following commands in the console. Sometimes Blogdown will give you weird errors if you run this code in a newly created R script file, so avoid making any new files until the commands below are executed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)

# install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;) #OR THE FOLLOWING LINE BELOW
# devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/blogdown&quot;)

# blogdown::new_site()</code></pre>
<p>Once you install Blogdown, the following dropdown menu should appear titled “Addins”.</p>

</p>
<p>You can either use this to serve your site (preview it without deploying), or by running the command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># blogdown::serve_site()
# Stop the site with 
# blogdown::stop_server()</code></pre>
<p>Any new posts (.md or .rmd) should be located in your content/post folder. Be very careful as to what directory your files are located in, since the new_site() function is very particular with file locations.</p>
<p>Follow the example posts for a framework to work on for future posts. Before we commit to Github, create a new file titled ‘.gitignore’. If you encounter trouble creating it due to the ‘.’ in the beginning, create a text file and name it whatever you want. Then:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Add the following to the text file:
# .Rproj.user
#.Rhistory
#.RData
#.Ruserdata
#public/

#then navigate to your current directory in terminal and type in:
#ren whatevernameyougavethefile.txt .gitignore</code></pre>
<p>Add/commit/push your changes to Github.</p>
<p>Almost there!</p>

<h1>Deploying your website</h1>
<p>Go to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/signup" class="uri">https://app.netlify.com/signup</a> and create an account through Github.</p>

<h2>Including Plots</h2>
<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>
<p><img src="/post/BuildingaBloginRStudio_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that the <code>echo = FALSE</code> parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</p>
