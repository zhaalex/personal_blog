This blog wasn't either.
<!--more-->

I've started to blog as a way to document my daily activities.  Often I find myself struggling to remember, and it's also a way to reflect on life.

I'm mostly known for my pet ducks, but also for jazz trombone, boxing, and being a cadet at the Army ROTC program at my university.  Future posts will range from highlights of a photography portfolio I've been building to random updates.  

Looking forward to building this into a sweet online art gallery and showcase of my life!  

I'd like to end on an inside joke and essential phrase that has been carefully constructed during my time in Cape Town.

**When in Rome** (pronounced */węnn inn rœwmeh/*)

- a phrase that can be applied to anything and will immediately make you look like you know what you're talking about
