&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil Pump started on Soundcloud.  Lil Gravy did too, but no one knows him.  Drake definitely didn't start from the bottom, contrary to his hit "Started from the Bottom", but now he's relatively successful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt Disney had humble beginnings as a farm boy.  He was also widely regarded as a racist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Jobs dropped out of college to travel the world and to find himself.  Now, I can't replace the battery on my cracked iPhone 6 Plus until I pay $200 to fix the screen just so the technicians can access the battery.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard Schultz grew up in less-than-ideal conditions in Brooklyn, and his parents worked long hours to support the family.  Later, he would become the CEO of Starbucks, and I now have the privilege of paying almost $5 for a Venti Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this related to this blog?  Not much, but everyone starts somewhere, and they also end somewhere.  This may sound very obvious.  It is.  Thus, I'll be documenting my journey through these numerous blog posts.

#### Formalities

I'll be graduating from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in May 2020 with a B.S.E. in Computer Science and possibly a B.F.E. in Jazz Studies for Trombone.  

As a cadet in the Wolverine Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Battalion, I am the current Color Guard Commander, managing pre-athletic activity ceremonial duties and collaborating with the Navy and Air Force, and I have also been a squad leader through numerous leadership rotations.  

Although it is very likely that I will discontinue the music degree, I have been the lead trombone for the Michigan Jazz Ensemble, Michigan's premier big band, for the past two years.  This past May (2018), I went on a one-week educational tour in the Syracuse/New York City area, where we performed and held master classes with numerous high schools.  

I've tried my hand at boxing this year as a member of the Michigan Club Boxing B Team in the spring, and I'll be looking to compete for the A Team in the upcoming fall.  I'm also member of Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity, where I managed the production of recruitment videos and recently joined the web development committee.

Lastly, when my friends hear "Zhang," the first thing that comes to mind is my pet Pekin ducks, raising them since my sophomore year of high school.

I'm excited to see where this blog/website goes, so tune in periodically for some quality content!
