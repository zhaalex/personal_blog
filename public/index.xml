      <description>This blog wasn&amp;rsquo;t either.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started to blog as a way to document my daily activities. Often I find myself struggling to remember, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a way to reflect on life.
I&amp;rsquo;m mostly known for my pet ducks, but also for jazz trombone, boxing, and being a cadet at the Army ROTC program at my university. Future posts will range from highlights of a photography portfolio I&amp;rsquo;ve been building to random updates.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
